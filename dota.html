	<h2><em>The Gameplay of Dota 2</em></h2>
	<img src="dotagame.jpg" alt="Game Picture"/>
	<p>Dota 2 is a 5 versus 5, team based games. Each player picks one hero per match, and plays as that hero for the rest of the match. The objective of each team is destroy the structures of the enemy team. The structures are divided into towers which defends the lane and attack the enemy heroes when they push, barracks which create small creeps that populate the game, naturally pushing lanes and fighting enemy creeps and giving enemy heroes something to farm, and the ancient which is the final objective that needs to be destroyed to win the game.</p>
	<p>Each team is traditionally divided into five positions. Position 1 is the carry, who will be the late game powerhouse that will lead you to victory. Position 2 is the mid player, who will play the mid lane solo, and provide a strong mid game force to ensure that the enemy team isn't able to pressure them. Position 3 is the tank, who will be there to soak all the damage, especially in a team fight. Position 4 is the soft support, whose job is to provide support to the tank, as well as roaming around the map early game, disrupting the enemy gameplay. Position 5 is the hard support, whose job is to provide support to the carry. Usually the position 5 will sacrifice themselves in order to save the position 1 if they're in danger.</p>
	
	<h2><em>My Favorite Hero in Dota 2</em></h2>
	<img src="fvlogo.jpg" alt="Faceless Void Picture"/>
	<p>My favorite hero in the game is Faceless Void. He's a position 1 carry hero, and an absolute force in the game. Once farmed, taking care of any enemy is rarely a problem for him, if ever. He has four skills. His first skill is Time Walk. It lets him jump a short distance in any direction, reversing any damage he took up until 2 seconds before he casts the skill. This lets him be incredibly mobile, jumping towards the enemy to initiate, or away when he needs to escape. His second skill is Time Dilation. When cast, this causes enemy heroes within a certain radius to be slowed, as well as the cooldowns on their reset, making them unable to cast their spells. His third skill is Time Lock, which gives every attack of his a small chance to lock an enemy unit in time, and attack them a second time. This is his primary damage dealing skill. This fourth and ultimate skill is Chronosphere, which creates a bubble which traps all units except him inside it. This is a double edged sword, as if it's cast well, it can have the potential to trap an entire enemy team, leaving them completely defenseless, or if cast wrong, can trap his team in, leaving them to be slaughtered.sssss</p>
